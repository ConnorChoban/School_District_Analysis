# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to compare test results from several different high schools within one school district to look for evidence of academic dishonesty. Specifically, we'll be examining how the math, reading, and overall test results for students at Thomas High School differ from similar schools and whether or not there is evidence of academic dishonesty.
